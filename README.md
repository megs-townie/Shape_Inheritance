# Geometric Shapes Area Calculator

## Overview

This Java application is designed to calculate and display the areas of various geometric shapes, including circles, squares, and triangles. It showcases object-oriented programming concepts in Java, particularly inheritance and encapsulation. Each shape is represented by a class with its own specific attributes and methods.

## Features

- **Circle Area Calculation**: Calculates and displays the area of a circle.
- **Square Area Calculation**: Calculates and displays the area of a square.
- **Triangle Area Calculation**: Calculates and displays the area of a triangle.

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- A Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) or a simple text editor.

### Compilation and Execution

1. Copy the provided Java code into a file named `Main.java`. Ensure that the `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` classes are also defined in their respective files or within the same file.
2. Open your Java IDE or command line tool.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `Main.java`.
4. Compile the program:
   - In the IDE: Use the built-in compile and run tools.
   - In the command line: Run `javac Main.java` to compile.
5. Run the compiled program:
   - In the IDE: Run the program using the IDE's run tool.
   - In the command line: Run `java Main`.

## Usage

- On running the program, it instantiates objects of `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle`.
- For each shape, the program calculates its area based on the given dimensions and prints the result.
